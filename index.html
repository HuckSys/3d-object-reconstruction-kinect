<p>The primary purpose of this project was to delve into the field of computer vision by starting on a rather well-solved problem of three-dimensional object reconstruction. Prior to the advent of the Microsoft Kinect sensor, researchers from universities around the world have tried to generate accurate 3D models of physical object using sensors such as LIDARs and Time-of-Flight cameras. With the introduction of the extremely cheap Microsoft Kinect and the Microsoft SDK, other open-source libraries such as the Point Cloud Library and OpenCV were born. Serving to eliminate the complex mathematics involved behind computer vision algorithms, these libraries, meant to complement and enhance user interactions and data processing with the Kinect, prodded the migration of 3D reconstruction research from university labs to amateur hackers and techies. Though the 3D reconstruction field has not yet fully developed, but amateurs and professionals are boosting this area knowledge.</p>

<p>Most 3D reconstruction processes tend to follow a general pipeline with some deviations, which occur due to the tradeoff between efficiency and quality and general preferences for one algorithm over the other. There are two main types of reconstruction processes-environment and object. This paper focuses on object reconstruction as it tends to be a simpler version of environment reconstruction, but is based on similar principles.</p>

<h4>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stage 1: Acquiring Input Data</h4>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>The first stage of the pipeline initializes the Microsoft Kinect sensor and configures it to acquire raw depth data. The object of concern is placed on a flat surface with very few or no background objects. The user then captures depth data for the object under consideration from at least six different angles. Any less than six depth images will yield a loosely knit and erroneous reconstruction. These raw depth images are stored as point cloud data into .pcd files, where each view of the object corresponds to a separate .pcd file. No color data is acquired in order to speed up processing time in subsequent stages. At this point, the user should have at least six .pcd files in their working directory.</p>
